Hello,
creating, then testing if it works or not, and afterwards worrying - hmmm, maybe you can do it better, so one more time modyfying and testing, testing... Such attitude I remember beginning from my childhood. So, yes - coding for fun, but I would start to learn how to code more effectively to start earn some money, not just for fun.
